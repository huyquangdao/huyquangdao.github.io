My name is Dao Quang Huy. Currently, I'm a first-year PhD student at School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University (SCIS - SMU). Prior to my PhD career, I worked as a Research Engineer at Singapore Management University (SMU), under the supervision of Assistant Professor Dr. <a href='https://liziliao.github.io'>Liao Lizi </a>. Previously, I joined the 1st Batch of the FPT AI Residency Program and worked with Dr. <a href='https://andrew-dungle.github.io'>Dung D. Le </a> who is an Assistant Professor at VinUniversity, Vietnam. In 2021, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University (UET - VNU). More details can be found in my <a href = ''>CV</a>.

My research directions focus on Natural Language Processing, Graph Neural Network. Besides, I'm also interested in emerging research topics such as Task-oriented Dialogue Systems, Conversational Recommendation, and Large Language Models. My research aims to address following problems:

- Dialogue Policy Planning under Proactive Dialogue Scenarios.
- Retrieval-augmented Generation and Recommendation.
